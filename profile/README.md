# Warwick Student Arts Festival

Warwick Student Arts Festival (WSAF) is a 3 day showcase and
celebration of all aspects of the arts here at Warwick!

Every day will feature a morning-to-evening programme of events
including theatre, dance, music, film, literature, comedy and art held
across the entirety of campus. If you have a show, some art, a dance,
a poem or anything in-between that you want to show, we'd love to see
you there!
